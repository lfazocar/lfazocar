### Hi I'm Felipe!

I'm an aspiring developer from Chile, fresh out of a Ruby on Rails bootcamp and excited to get started in the world of web development!

Before embarking on this journey I was a lab rat, I used to work in a molecular biology lab while learning some bioinformatics and molecular dynamics on the side. These two topics make heavy use of coding which sparked my interest in the programming world and eventually made me change paths.

Besides Ruby, other languages I have used are Python, Javascript and C (the last two I learned mostly for fun ðŸ˜œ).
